# darknet_hpc_cluster
- This tutorial explains the darknet installation on a system with shared GPU.  
- In particular, it was tested on DTU's high performance computing (HPC) clusters.  
- However, the idea in the tutorial can be adopted to the similar systems.  
- Once the installation is complete, the working of Darknet is shown on a pretrained YoloV4 model. 
- See the step by step instructions in the jupyter notebook.
